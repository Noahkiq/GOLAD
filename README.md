# GOLAD
I made this because [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh)'s version is iOS only :(
  
Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkGZ2Hl1l8c) video for instructions on how to play and some background. Alternatively, you can play the tutorial provided in the game.

This version does not have online play.

## To Do List (feel free to do these things for me)

Make hard AI consider opponent moves in calculation

Put more options in the selection menu

Implement Cary's gameStrings
