# GOLAD
I made this because [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh)'s version is iOS only :(

If you want to just play the game, you don't need the GOLAD folder, that's just a bunch of messy source code.  

## How to Play

Watch these videos for instructions on how to play:
[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8RDs2u92MI) - [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKQJlvqhDzQ) - [Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkGZ2Hl1l8c)

## Differences

Unlike the version shown in the video, you can not save up moves. To summon a cell, you have to sacrafice two of your own.
This is also reflected in Cary's iOS version

This version does not have online play.

## Things I should do (feel free to do these things for me)


Make tutorial 

Fix it not launching?
